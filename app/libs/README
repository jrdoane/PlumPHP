PlumPHP - Application libraries.
(Unless you really want to write your entire application within just views and
controllers. I wouldn't recommend it though. --jdoane)

PlumPHP is a PHP framework that utilizes PHP 5.3 and PostgreSQL functionality.
Using these two technologies and deeply integrating them, the hope is to create
a platform for rapid development with high scalibility. This platform has
a large emphasis on static class methods and namespacing for organization.
