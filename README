PlumPHP is a PHP framework that utilizes PHP 5.3 and PostgreSQL functionality.
Using these two technologies and deeply integrating them, the hope is to create
a platform for rapid development with high scalibility. This platform has
a large emphasis on static class methods and namespacing for organization.

/public - WWW root, this is where you point your http server.
/plum - Core plum code, you shouldn't have to touch this under normal circumstances.
/config - All static config files go here.
/app - All of your application files go here.
    Plum uses an MVC architecture-like. System config settings determines what
    directory controllers and views go into, but they have to be in the app directory.
